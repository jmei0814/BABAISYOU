TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-27#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mb_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mb_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/clk_wiz/inst/clk_in1.

Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net Clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): Clk_IBUF_inst/O, HexA/Clk, mb_block_i/clk_100MHz
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP mb_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/sprite_inst/temp_rom_address1 input pin mb_block_i/hdmi_text_controller_0/inst/sprite_inst/temp_rom_address1/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
